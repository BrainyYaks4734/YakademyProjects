## coding: ep4 gyro turn
`author: Tyler`

### What is a gyro turn

A gyro turn is a way to do precise turning making use of the gyro sensor.
Instead of using imprecise turning that is built-in to the robot, a gyro turn does an in-place turn at very precise angles.

### Why do I need one

By default, turning blocks built-in to the robot are not very precise.
However, using a gyro turn, you can get much more precise movement.
While it can take a while to get working, it is very much worth it.

### Code
